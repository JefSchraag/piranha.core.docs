# Model Loader

> The Model Loader is part of the package `Piranha.AspNetCore` and is intended to be used when building integrated web applications with `ASP.NET`.

The Model Loader is a **scoped** service that simplifies model loading for Pages & Posts for the current request. It has support for loading unpublished content and drafts if the current user has access to it. It can be used both from your `.cshtml` views or pages, **or** from your backend `Controllers`.

## Registering The Service

The Model Loader is registered automatically when calling `UseCms` in `ConfigureServices`.

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms();

    ...
});
