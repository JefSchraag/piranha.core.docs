# Startup Options

When you add Piranha to your `Startup.cs` as described in [Application Setup](application-setup), all of the available middleware and routing components are added by default. While this is perfect for most green field websites you may need to control the exactly what parts of the pipeline that are active when integrating Piranha into an existing application.

#### AddRazorRuntimeCompilation

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.AddRazorRuntimeCompilation = true;
});
~~~

Enables runtime compilation for Razor `.cshtml` files. This is useful for development environments so that you don't have to restart the application every time you update a view or page. The default value of this property is **false** as you shouldn't have runtime compilation enabled in production.

### Routing

The following options is available when calling `UseCms()` to configure how the application listens to incoming requests.

#### UseAliasRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UseAliasRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If alias routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. The default value is **true**.

#### UseArchiveRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UseArchiveRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If archive routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. The default value is **true**.

#### UsePageRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UsePageRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If page routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. The default value is **true**.

#### UsePostRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UsePostRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If post routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. The default value is **true**.

#### UseSitemapRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UseSitemapRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If the middleware should listen for and handle incoming requests to `/sitemap.xml`. The default value is **true**.

#### UseSiteRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UseSiteRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If site routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. This can be disabled if you only have one site in your application. The default value is **true**.

#### UseStartpageRouting

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranha(options =>
{
    options.UseCms(o =>
    {
        o.UseStartpageRouting = false;
    });
});
~~~

If start page routing should be enabled in the middleware pipeline. The default value is **true**.

#### Using appsettings.json

Using the [options pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options) in ASP.NET Core you can also easily configure you routing options in your `appsettings.json`. Please note that this is just an example and your `appsettings.json` can have any structure you want.

**appsettings.json**
~~~
{
  "Piranha": {
    "Routing": {
      "UseSiteRouting": false
    }
  }
}
~~~

**Startup.cs**
~~~ csharp
public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    _config = configuration;
}

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddPiranha(options =>
    {
        options.UseCms(o =>
            _config.GetSection("Piranha")
                ?.GetSection("Routing")
                ?.Bind(o));
    });
}
