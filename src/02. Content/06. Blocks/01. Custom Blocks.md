# Custom Blocks

> This article covers how to implement custom blocks for Piranha. If you want to read more about the standard blocks included, please refer to [Blocks](../).

Blocks are the content pieces that the Administrators can use when designing the main content body. They main difference between `Fields` and `Blocks` is that blocks are intended to be more visual in their presentation than fields to give editors a clear understanding of the content they are creating.

## Reserved Names 

When naming your components, whether it's **fields**, **blocks** or **block groups** you should stay clear of the names already used by the internal components of the Piranha manager.

* `block-group-horizontal`
* `block-group-vertical`
* `block-group`
* `folder-item`
* `generic-block`
* `page-item`
* `pagecopy-item`
* `post-archive`
* `region`
* `sitemap-item`

## Block initialization

After all of the block fields have been initialized additional initialization can be performed on the block itself for loading or preparing data based on the values of the fields.

##### Init

~~~ csharp
// Synchronous Init method
void Init(...);

// Asyncronous Init method
Task Init(...);
~~~

Initializes the block for client use. This is called when the block is loaded and is used for loading additional resources. 

The method supports **Dependency Injection** which means that **any service registered** in the DI Container can be added as an parameter. This is useful when loading custom data from your application.

##### Manager Init

~~~ csharp
// Synchronous Init method
void InitManager(...);

// Asyncronous Init method
Task InitManager(...);
~~~

Initializes the block when it's loaded from within the manager. Just like the regular `Init` method it supports **Dependency Injection** so that you can use any service registered in the DI Container.

## Creating a Block

A block is in essence a class that inherits from the abstract base class `Piranha.Extend.Block`. A block can contain **one or several** fields, it can actually contain data that is not a field as well, but only properties that derive from `Piranha.Extend.IField` will be saved in the database. All blocks need to be marked with the `BlockType` attribute.

As an example, let's take a look at how the **Quote** block is implemented.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha.Extend;
using Piranha.Extend.Fields;

[BlockType(Name = "Quote", Category = "Content",
    Icon = "fas fa-quote-right", Component = "quote-block")]
public class QuoteBlock : Block
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets/sets the text body.
    /// </summary>
    public TextField Body { get; set; }
}
~~~

### Generic Blocks

All of the standard blocks included in Piranha has their own `Vue` component rendering them in the manager, but sometime you might just want to add a block that is not that visual and just gives the editor a form with the available fields in it.

By omitting the `Component` property of the `BlockTypeAttribute` Piranha will automatically handle the rendering of the block the same way it would with a region. Let's for example say we wanted an Author block that we could add at the bottom of our Posts.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha.Extend;
using Piranha.Extend.Fields;

[BlockType(Name = "Author", Category = "Content", Icon = "fas fa-use")]
public class AuthorBlock : Block
{
    public StringField Name { get; set; }

    public ImageField Image { get; set; }

    public HtmlField Description { get; set; }
}
~~~

The edit model for the block used for the manager interface is different in the way that instead of sending the actual `AuthorBlock` as the model it sends an array of the fields together with meta-data for rendering. Please note that it's completely possible to use this edit model for your custom block components as well, by setting the `IsGeneric` property together with a `Component`.

~~~ csharp
[BlockType(Name = "Author", Category = "Content", Icon = "fas fa-use",
    Component = "author-block", IsGeneric = true)]
~~~

### Block Configuration

In order to register your block you need to mark it with the `BlockType` attribute like in the above example. This has the following properties.

##### Name

~~~ csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
~~~

This is the name that is shown in the manager interface when editing.

##### Category

~~~ csharp
public string Category { get; set; }
~~~

The name of category the Block will be grouped under in the manager interface.

##### Icon

~~~ csharp
public string Icon { get; set; }
~~~

Css class for rendering the Block icon in the manager interface. The manager interface uses the free icon package from **font awesome**.

##### IsUnlisted

~~~ csharp
public bool IsUnlisted { get; set; }
~~~

If you're developing a block that is supposed to be used within a Block Group you should set this to `true`. This will prevent it from being shown elsewhere when adding Blocks.

##### Component

~~~ csharp
public string Component { get; set; }
~~~

The name of the global `Vue` component that should be used when rendering the block in the manager.

## Register The Block

All available blocks has to be registered in the singleton `Piranha.App` **after** the app has been initialized.

~~~ csharp
Piranha.App.Init(api);

// Register custom blocks
Piranha.App.Blocks.Register<MyCustomBlock>();
~~~

## Create The Manager Component

The manager interface is based on `Vue.js` and assumes that all blocks are registered as **global components**. As these components are written in `Javascript` you need to register your custom resources in the manager. For more information about this, please refer to [Resources](../manager-extensions/resources) in the section **Manager Extensions**.

> ##### A note on block templates
> The root element of the block template **needs** to have the class `block-body` for the manager interface
> to be able to collapse it in the edit view.

Let's again take a look at how the component for the **Quote** block is implemented:

~~~ js
/*global
    piranha
*/

Vue.component("quote-block", {
    props: ["uid", "toolbar", "model"],
    methods: {
        onBlur: function (e) {
            this.model.body.value = e.target.innerText;
        }
    },
    computed: {
        isEmpty: function () {
            return piranha.utils.isEmptyText(this.model.body.value);
        }
    },
    template:
        "<div class='block-body' :class='{ empty: isEmpty }'>" +
        "  <i class='fas fa-quote-right quote'></i>" +
        "  <p class='lead' contenteditable='true' spellcheck='false' " +
        "    v-html='model.body.value' v-on:blur='onBlur'></p>" +
        "</div>"
});
~~~

### Component Properties

All field components get three properties from the main edit views in the manager interface.

##### uid

A globally unique id that can be used in the component when rendering more complex views. This field is generated at runtime and will be different each time for every field.

##### toolbar

The id of the container that toolbars should be positioned inside, for example when using the `Tiny MCE` editor.

##### model

The model value from the block instance.
